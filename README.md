# SW-Libs
My own implementations of most used software libs written in C and C++17/20.
These libraries consist different data structures and algorithms that were written by myself and including exception handling and thread safety.
Libraries were tested on WindowsX64 and Linux ubuntu machines and passed unit tests, debugging and are maintained for bug fixing.
These low level libraries and projects can be used for many sort of DIY software projects.
